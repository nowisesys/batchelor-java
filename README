** BatchelorWebService - client side Java (tm) library for Batchelor **

** INTRODUCTON:

   The purpose of this library is to let developers create applications that
   integrates with the batchelor web service interfaces (RESTful and SOAP), 
   without forcing them getting dirty in all details of encoding/decoding the 
   messages passed between the client and the server (the batchelor service).

   This library is only useful for people who wants to develop clients that
   interacts with the web application hosted by batchelor (the batch queue
   manager).

** API:

   The package se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor contains common classes and interfaces.
   All service specific classes (REST and SOAP) is found in their own packages.
   
   An simple example on using the REST interface with FOA as the result 
   encoding method:
   
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.*;
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.rest.*;
     
     class Client {
        
         private RestWebService service;
	 private FoaResponseDecoder decoder;
	
	 Client(URL url) {
	     decoder = new FoaResponseDecoder();
	     service = new RestWebService(url, decoder);
	 }
	 
	 // ... methods calling service.XXX()
	 
     }
     
   The kind of web service interfaces that can be used dependens on how
   the server (running batchelor) is configured.
