   BatchelorWebService - Java (tm) library for Batchelor Web Service API.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

** INTRODUCTON:

   This library makes it an easy task to write client side applications that
   integrates with Batchelor (the batch job queue manager) thru its web
   service interfaces (currently the SOAP and RESTful service are supported).
   
   The purpose is to present a simple to use API that allows end users to
   communicate with the web service, without having to get dirty in all
   details of encoding/decoding the messages passed between your application
   and the server. 

   The target audience are people writing client side applications or
   integrating Batchelor in bussiness-to-bussiness systems. Thoose who likes
   to roll their own bindings can still do so.

** API:

   The package se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor contains common classes and interfaces.
   All service specific classes (REST and SOAP) is found in their own packages.
   
   An simple example on using the REST interface with FOA as the response
   encoding method:
   
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.*;
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.rest.*;
     
     class Client {
        
         private RestWebService service;
	 private ResponseEncoder encoder;
	
	 Client(URL url) {
	     encoder = new ResponseEncoder.FOA;
	     service = new RestWebService(url, encoder);
	 }
	 
	 // ... methods calling service.XXX()
	 
     }
     
   The kind of web service interfaces that can be used dependens on how
   the server (that runs batchelor) is configured.
