    BatchelorWebService - Java (TM) library for the Batchelor Web Service API.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

** INTRODUCTION:

   This library makes it an easy task to write client side applications that
   integrates with Batchelor (the batch job queue manager) thru its web
   service interfaces (currently the SOAP and RESTful service are supported).
   
   The purpose is to present a simple to use API that allows end users to
   communicate with the web service, without having to get dirty in all
   details of encoding/decoding messages passed between your application
   and the server. 

   The target audience are people writing client side applications or
   integrating Batchelor in business-to-business systems. Those who likes
   to roll their own bindings can still do so.

** VERSION:

   This is version is 1.0.6 of the library, released 2018-07-25. The major and 
   minor numbers are based on the remote API it implements, while the revision 
   gets incremented on each release. 
   
   Works together with the batchelor 0.8.x releases. 
   
** DIRECTORIES:
   
   The client directory contains the core web service library. The explorer 
   directory contains a working sample GUI application built on Swing and SPI 
   using the library that can be extended by implementing custom display classes
   for viewing the browse tree nodes content.
   
** API:

   The package se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor contains common classes and interfaces.
   All service specific classes (REST and SOAP) is found in their own packages.
   
   An simple example showing how to use the REST service class with FOA as 
   the response encoding method:
   
     import java.rmi.RemoteException;
     import java.net.URL;
     
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.*;
     import se.uu.bmc.it.batchelor.rest.*;
     
     class RestServiceClient {
         
	 static {
	     // 
	     // Content handling must be initialized once and is global for the 
	     // whole application and its entire lifetime.
	     // 
	     ContentHandlerFactory factory = ResponseDecoderFactory.getInstance();
             HttpURLConnection.setContentHandlerFactory(factory);	
	 }
	 
         private BatchelorRestClient client;
         
	 public RestServiceClient(URL url) {
	     client = new RestWebService(url, ResponseEncoder.FOA);
	 }
	 
	 // ... methods calling client.XXX()
	 
     }
     
   The kind of web service interfaces that can be used dependence on how
   the server (that runs batchelor) is configured.
